# HAVS Device Simulator
 
This repo contains an Arduino file that you can use out-of-the-box on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and probably any other Nano 33 BLE boards.

It can also be tweaked for any other boards.

## What does it do?
The code simulates a real HAVS Protect device that sends values to an app via BLE. This code produce random values when connected to a BLE client/app.
